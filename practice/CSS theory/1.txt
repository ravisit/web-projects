What is CSS?
CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

--The href attribute of the <link> element needs to reference a file on your file system.
--An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, 
  you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>.
--Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute.
eg.
 p {
  color: red;
}

P - this is the selector(A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content). (A html element which is about to styled.)
   a[title] { } -- attribute selector.
   a[href="https://example.com"] { } -- attribute selector with presence of attribute value.
   .class -- class selector
   p -- html type selector.
   #id -- id selector
   a:hover { } -- :hover(pseudo-class) selector.
   p::first-line { } -- ::first-line(pseudo-element) selector. (It will select only first line of text in the paragraph element.
   article > p { } - select the direct child of <article> element. > is combinator selector
   p + img {} - select the sibling img of p.
   p ~ img {} - select the img anywhere after p.
   * {
    margin: 0;
     }  --- universal selector. it will select everything in the document.
    
   
   
color:red; - This is declaration. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
color - is the property
red - is the property value.


---------------------------------------------
padding -- the space around the content.
border -- the solid line that is just outside the padding.
margin -- the space around the outside of the border.

margin: 0 auto; -- When you set two values on a property like margin or padding, the first value affects the
		 element's top and bottom side (setting it to 0 in this case); the second value affects the left and right 
		 side. (Here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal space evenly between left and right).

Styling based on state:-

a:link{
  color:pink;
}
a:visited{
color: green;
}
a:hover{
text-decoration:none;
}
-------------------------------------------------

!important changes the way the cascade normally works.
